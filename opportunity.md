# Open Opportunity
â€‹Our research focuses on magnetic navigation of multi-scale medical robots (e.g. capsule robots, flexible robots, micro-nano robots), which includes pose tracking, shape sensing, path planning, actuation and locomotion, manipulation and control. Expertise in modeling, design, simulation, and prototyping of mechatronic and robotic systems are welcomed.
